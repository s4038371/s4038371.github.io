    <h1>Shengyang Assignment 1</h1>
    <!-- Q1 --><h2 class="dancing-script">
        <br>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
    <p class="dancing-script">
        I think the first thing I pay attention to during the interaction process is the layout of the page. 
        A clear and easy to read page will make me want to continue browsing. 
        Secondly, I will focus on the main parts of presenting text and the interactive parts.</p>
    <!-- Q2 --><h2 class="dancing-script">
        <br>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2>
    <p class="dancing-script">
        The website I experienced is https://playtest.downstream.game/ 
        This is a website for playing simple small games. 
        It is mainly composed of various interactive buttons, with very little text.</p>
    <!-- Q3 --><h2 class="dancing-script">
        <br>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
    <p class="dancing-script">
        I spent the most time experiencing the content of this mini game and figuring out the functions of each button. 
        The layout of this page is neat, with each button designed to be prominent and easy to read, 
        providing a clear visual understanding of the button's function. 
        The rest is just playing this simple little game, 
        which will give different feedback when I make different reactions, very innovative.</p>
    <!-- Q4 --><h2 class="dancing-script">
        <br>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
    <p class="dancing-script">
        Click, the button icons on this page are very textured, 
        and there is no complex audio or text content that requires extra attention, 
        so I spent all my time clicking these buttons and observing feedback in different situations.</p>
    <!-- Q5+6 --><h2 class="dancing-script">
        <br>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?<br>
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>
    <p class="dancing-script">
        My first impression of this page was that it was a machine similar to a calculator or typewriter. 
        The page conveyed this impression through an ordered arrangement of buttons and added some realistic 
        parts (such as printing receipts). Interestingly, this page added a main power button, 
        and when the power was turned off, all buttons on the page would fail and the brightness would decrease. 
        I think this interesting design well demonstrates the core design concept of this page.</p>
    <!-- Q7 --><h2 class="dancing-script">
        <br>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? 
        (For how long and how many different times)</h2>
    <p class="dancing-script">
        This page is a small game page, and as I continue to play this game, 
        its content will become more complex and the text feedback in the dialog box will change accordingly. 
        When I press the wrong button, it will give different negative reactions depending on the situation.</p>
    <!-- Q8 --><h2 class="dancing-script">
        <br>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
    <p class="dancing-script">
        At this point, the page is quite simple. 
        There is a prominent display screen with text indicating the current progress, 
        and an interesting emoji is added next to it to complement the text.</p>
    <!-- Q9 --><h2 class="dancing-script">
        <br>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
    <p class="dancing-script">
        This website should have been designed based on some kind of computer prototype, 
        including keyboard like buttons, glass textured display screens, adjustable sliders, 
        and some decorative screws and metal plates.</p>
    <!-- Q10 --><h2 class="dancing-script">
        <br>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
    <p class="dancing-script">
        It is obvious that the theme design of this website is in line with people's understanding of 
        interactive machines such as keyboard keys. A display screen with a series of orderly arranged 
        keys clearly guides users to try and press different buttons, 
        and focuses on the text content on the display screen.</p>
    <!-- Q11 --><h2 class="dancing-script">
        <br>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
    <p class="dancing-script">
        I think this website is more of a webpage focused on interesting interactivity, 
        so what I feel more is that it is an interesting and valuable design with reference value, 
        and I haven't felt any other directional feelings.</p>
    <!-- Q12 --><h2 class="dancing-script">
        <br>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>
    <p class="dancing-script">
        The main interactive part on this page is only the left half of the webpage, 
        and a lot of space is used to place buttons on the right half for jumping to other pages, 
        which are larger and more prominent. I don't think this is a satisfactory part for me, 
        perhaps because the interactive part of this mini game is not the purpose of this page, 
        but I think the layout is quite unreasonable.</p>
    <!-- Q13 --><h2 class="dancing-script">
        <br>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>
    <p class="dancing-script">
        The most satisfying aspect is the eye-catching visual design of the page, 
        with a simple overall layout and UI design that makes the page look like a sophisticated instrument, 
        giving people a strong desire to continue exploring and clicking on these buttons.</p>
